# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? ***I am struggling with the general concept of hashes vs classes and standard variables. 
It will help for me to review this lesson multiple times and update my notes.***
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?***I am taking notes, mostly for vocabulary at the beginning of a lesson. I find it helpful to write down the syntax examples for quick reference later on. My notes become more detailed and helpful as I begin coding with the new syntax and run into problems, because the problems lead to new
lessons learned (clarity) related to the material.***
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?***I always try to solve the problem on my own first and only turn to the internet when my notes fail me.***
